Nowadays Residual neural network (ResNet), a variant of Convolutional Neural Network which use the skip or residual connections, is widely used for improving performance of fine-grained classification problem, such as birds classification. We refer related references and documentation, apply Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) to improve test accuracy on birds classification. After implement our DenseNet model with PyTorch, we also find four ways to improve accuracy of our birds classification model, which are using ImageNet to pre-training model, choosing better DenseNet structure, adding Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Networks and try some extra operations such as rotation on training images. Finally, the maximum test accuracy of our model is 0.862.
